## Pokedex App

> I built a JavaScript App using a Pokemon API

- Uses HTML, CSS and Javascript, with Bootstrap UI pattern
- It creates a button for each Pokemon, listing its name
    - On user action (click), each button then pops up a modal for that particular Pokemon's stats (weight, height, and types)
- Has a search bar to filter down the pokemon by name
